# Market_Basket_Analysis_Apriori_Algorithm_Clustering_Model_-_Anomoly_Detection_Model
This Notebook Contains Apriori Algorithm for Market Basket Analysis, Clustering Model for HR Analysis of Promotion & Anomoly Detection on Aireline Satisfaction.

## Task 1

 Use the Dataset named Market_Basket_Optimisation to build an apriori algorithm to solve the below questions
- Find the top 10 rules when making buy 1 get 1 free offer.
- What change can you see in the rules, if the offer is changes as buy 2 get 2 free?

## Task 2

Use the HR Promotion Dataset given below to build a clustering model. Before building the model, handle the missing values in the data.
- What should be the ideal number of clusters.
- What do you infer from the clusters?

## Task 3

Use the dataset named Airline Satisfaction to build an anomaly detection model and answer the below questions
- a) What is the accuracy of the model, if 10% of the data is affected by anomalies.
- b) Is this model performing better than using a random forest classification model for the same data? Explain why or why not.
